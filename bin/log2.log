  Welcome to master-blaster! This program renames primary branches for GitHub users!
  We'll go through the options before making any changes!

    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

Working on `show w' and `show c', actually! It's GNU public 3+! No closed versions!

  GitHub is deprecating password-based token generation! This is great for
  security, it's going to mean you're going to have to go to GitHub.com and
  come back with an access token to make this program work, though. The next
  question will determine whether the program needs a token with the more
  general `repo` scope or the more limited `public_repo` scope. You can run
  this program again if you're happy with the results!

  Please enter your GitHub username!                                                      
 f                                                                                        
? GitHub username: f?  Yes                                                                
? 
  What set of repositories do you want to update?                                         
  All repositories I'm the owner, collaborator, and/or organization member, public and pri
vate.                                                                                     
? 
  What would you like to call your primary branches? (Default 'main'.)                    
  All primary branches renamed to 'main'.                                                 
? 
  Repositories not present locally will be cloned to a temporary folder,
  updated, the update pushed, (the default branch on GitHub.com updated,)
  and then deleted locally. We can decrease the use of bandwidth and reduce
  potential conflicts by scanning for repositories that *are* present locally.
  Is this okay? (No other changes will be added or committed.)                            
  Yes                                                                                     
? 
    Do you keep your projects in a certain directory? Type that in here to
    speed up search! Like /Users/gareth/Code ... default is ~/, hit enter for default.    
                                                                                          
? 
    Default: use '~/' for local directory search?                                         
  Yes                                                                                     
? 
        Last step! Since password-based token generation is being deprecated, please
        get a personal access token with the correct scope(s) in order to run this
        program. To get this token, go to https://github.com, sign in, then go to
        'Settings', then 'Developer Settings', then 'Personal access tokens', then
        'Generate new token', confirm your password, name the token in the 'Note'
        input field, and select the repo scope, then 'Generate Token', then
        copy it to your clipboard and either paste it back here into the prompt, or
        save it first in case there's an error and you need to retry. (Recommended)       
     j
